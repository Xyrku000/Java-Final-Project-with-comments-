# Java-Final-Project-with-comments-
This is my final project for an introductory Java class I took in 2022.
It is a fun text adventure! If it were the 1970s, I could call this my first short choice-based video game.
It shows my competency in scripting in functional programming languages -- Java here, and Python and C++ more generally -- including that of debugging, testing, loops and selection statements, control flow, and arrays.
Note: the more I use graphics-based features -- such as color-coded text here in this project -- the more I am inspired to learn front-end languages such as CSS and Html. I would also enjoy figuring out how computer graphics work (beyond turtle graphics!).
